=== Gameplay ===

Player chooses a card on his deck
    - disable opponent decks, not selectable / clickable
    - if player's turn in move is 1 (i.e. first one to choose a card / initial card in move cards), then all cards should be available
    - if player's turn in move is not 1 then disable cards that are not valid
        - if initial card is trump and player has a trump, then only trump cards are available
        - if initial card is trump and player has only non-trump cards, then all card is available
        - if initial card is non-trump and player has matching suite card(s), then only a matching suite card(s) is(are) available
        - if initial card is non-trump and player does not have matching suite card, then all cards are available

    

When player clicks on an available card, the card should be taken of his hand and put in the move cards place
    - the game tracks which player owned each card in move cards

    -> 

When each player has made a move (i.e. move cards contains 3 cards) the winning card is determined
    - if winning card belonged to Big One it is placed in Big Ones played cards stack
    - if winning card belonged to Small One it is placed in Small Ones played cards stack

The initial turn for next move is assigned to player who owned the winning card

After players have ran out of cards, each groups total score is determined
    - total score is the sum of all card values contained in their stack

Then each player's score is added to individual and global scoreboard
