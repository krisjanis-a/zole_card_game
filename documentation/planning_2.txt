The plan is to create a Zole game application.



	<- Application user story ->


User can decide whether to play single player against computer AI players or online multiplayer with real people.


	<- Plan ->

- Create rough version without polished visuals (e.g. in console for logic)

- Then create visuals with image like things using a graphics engine

- Then create 3D visuals


	<- Steps ->

- Understand how to display the game -> what graphics engine to use, what objects (sprites, 3d models...) to use

- Create visuals for the game and get them working in the graphics engine

- Learn all the rules of Zole

- Create computer players' AI

- Result determination

- Create menu visuals

- Create game area visuals

- Where the game will be displayed? Browser or stand-alone application?



	<- Ideas / Brainstorm ->

How to handle in game state? Redux...?
