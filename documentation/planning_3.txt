Data which game needs while running:

    - player names
    - player hands
    - player scores
    - current move cards
    - which player is the big one

    - which seat each player has taken

___

I don't know... maybe should add redux and state management since it will probably be needed in future

Tas atvieglotu darbības komponentēs un loģikas savienošanu ar vizuālo/grafisko reprezentāciju

Kad redux store ir gatavs tad jāizdomā kā realizēt game loop

    - Viens variants ir glabāt spēles sesijas stāvokli redux, visu kas ārpus spēles ...?


Data

    - Data for game
    - Data for whole session

    - Player's private data / history somewhere in database

____

Actions

- make move => take card from hand and add to move cards
- add table to hand of big one
- get winner of move
- assign next move
- computer make move
- 

//============================================================

- To card component => add action-on-click property, which determines what happens to the card onClick

        => card click action will be determined by 
            1) knowing current seat => from that can get necessary info about player (read "Add owner property..." below)
            2) game phase => allows to determine what happens when a card is clicked

*Add owner property to each card => owner property lets you know if it is card owner's turn to make an action, if not => card cannot be clicked
    => this in turn will make it easier to operate on card logics and visuals
