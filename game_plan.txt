I.I

What are the main parts of the game?

	- Game Logic
	- Game Visuals / Graphics

|==============================================|

I.II

What tasks are there in each of these parts?
________________________________________________

-> Game Logic

	--> Objects / Models

		- Player Info
		- Cards
		- Decks

	--> Computer Player AI

	--> Code / Scripts

		- Calculate game score

	--> Rules of the game

	--> LeaderBoards & Database

	--> Score keeping

	--> 

	...
________________________________________________

-- Game Visuals / Graphics

	--> Learn three.js & WebGL & Blender

	--> Create 3D models (.gltf & Blender Files)

	--> Connecting logic with 3D models

	--> Create visualizations & sync them together cohesively

	...
________________________________________________

-- Random questions / problems / ideas

	--> While developing logic should create simple html/css UI not to have to work in terminal all the time, especially when Flow Testing 

	- How to deal cards?

	- How to randomize Decks

	- How to position objects in the world?

	- How to create global time for different events / animations that need to happen in the game?

	- Where do we need to use three.js/WebGL and where html/css/javascript is sufficient?

	- Dealing with framerate

	- Set the leader of trick / move

	- Should I operate with cardIDs instead of card Objects?
			-> Pros cardIDs
				+ smaller array of data => only IDs
				+ smaller chance of making spelling mistakes due to naming (number vs multi-word name...)
				+ easier to iterate

			-> Cons cardIDs
				- lengthier data access process
				- less data

			-> Pros Card Object
				+ more data available
				+ quicker access to all data / less steps

			-> Cons Card Object
				- need to go through cards object to get to specific card object
				- using multi-word name as keys makes it prone to errors
				- harder to iterate
				- larger data structure


			===> Going with cardIDs method for now...
