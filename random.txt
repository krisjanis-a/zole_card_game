-- Create snippets from popular songs and add as background music (e.g. Limp Bizkit - Behind Blue Eyes Interlude Part)

-- Add card sound effects when dealing and making a move

|=====|

- Get cards displayed on the game screen
- Make cards clickable with specific actions


|=====|

TODOs 7.12

- Create data structures in redux state
- Add hands to state
- Make cards appear on correct positions on screen depending on state


|=====|

Create game initialization function that asynchronously goes through steps: 
    - assigns turns depending on previous round's winner / winning seat
    - prompts choosing big beginning next to previous initial chooser
    - assigns big, adds table to big one's handle
    - waits for big one to drop two cards to his stack

Create game function that asynchronously
    - checks if there are still moves to be made
    - asks current turn / seat player to choose move card (add to current move cards)
    - asks following seats to choose move cards (add to current move cards)
    - determines winning card, winning card's owner
    - add card to corresponding stack (big/small)
    - assigns current turn to winning player
    - repeat

    - if no more moves can be made determine results of big and small ones


|=====|

Current progress:
    - game can be played
    - correct players are selected after choosing big & making moves
    - game results can be calculated & and displayed


TODOs

|I|
- create the rules / logic for all game modes

    - normal mode (parastā zole) [N]
        Options for normal mode if all players pass:
        - table (galdiņš - no one picks up table) [T]
        - dues (pules (couldn't think of better word in english) - special way of counting points, game is not played, new game started)
    
    - small zole (mazā zole - one who chooses this cannot pick up any move card stack or he loses) [S]

    * Overall there are 4 modes in which to player
        1. Normal game [N] with dues
        2. Play Table [T] - game with option to play without table participation
        3. Small Zole [S] - mode which adds option to play small zole ("mazā zole") (no play table option, with dues)
        4. Small Zole + Table [TS] - game mode where there is option to play small zole and table ( no dues)



|===================================================|

- create scoreboard accounting logic / functionality

Data needed to determine score for each player:
    - is player big / small?
    - what type of game was played:
        - normal
        - zole
        - small zole
        - table
    - big one's score & small ones' score
    
Determining and assigning scores to players logic / function

|===================================================|

conditions when game is finished:
    - all players have 0 cards in hands
    - big one plays small zole and collects move cards stack
    - all players pass (dues)

|===================================================|

Current progress 26.12.2021

- Round can be played in all modes
- Results can be calculated and added to scoreboard (no dues implementation yet)

|===================================================|

- create auto-play option for development (or better yet - create simple opponent AI)

- card stacks display in "messy" way

- show loaders / icons one player during their move / choosing turn and other information badges

- add permanent scoreboard to display

- 3d-ize all the environment before using WebGL (maybe...)

- develop opponent AI

- game settings

- save users on database

- in game currency

- session history

- game tutorials

- instructions

- description

- live playing online (web sockets, live server etc.)
